# NMPC_Terminal_Region
The nonlinear MPC scheme with guaranteed maximal terminal region based stability

The model is from Chen et. al AUTOMATICA 1998.

The get_max_terminal.m adopts the algorithm from Chen, W. H., O'Reilly, J., & Ballance, D. J. (2003). On the terminal region of model predictive control for non‚Äêlinear systems with input/state constraints. International journal of adaptive control and signal processing, 17(3), 195-207.
